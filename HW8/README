1.  This assignment is relevant to an Intro to Unix course because although we learn Python on the side, we miss a lot of the versitility of the language.  This assignment has the student look up random imports that they may be able to utilize if they decide to use Python for the final project.  Additionally, it shows them where they can find good examples, and has them looking up information online.

2. 10 points should be given for each explaination of the import.  If more are given, allow for optional extra credit, to a certain point.  If no *.py file is submitted, then give 0 points.
